## Creation Process

To build Rethink My Room I followed a design thinking process, which involved several steps:

## Content Building: 

### Branding 🛡™

**Objectives**:

-  Create a link and a relationship with the community.
-  Communicate the value of the offerings.
-  Make an impression.
-  Differentiate the store from the others.
-  Create a visual identity that matches business expectations.

> I created a visual identity that aligned with the business goals, differentiated the store from others, and communicated the value of offerings to the community. This involved creating a link with the community and making a lasting impression.


**Graphical Charter Drafting**: I brainstormed to come up with the name, logo, favicon, fonts, and colors that best represented the brand identity.

**Marketing**: I created offers, developed copywriting and ghostwriting, designed forms, developed FAQs, and created a sales funnel to promote the products and services.

**Site Building**: I used Elementor and Astra theme to build the site from scratch, and integrated WooCommerce for the e-commerce functionality. This involved WordPress customization, designing the sales page, UI/UX design, empathy mapping, illustration, wireframing, copywriting, and negotiation. Finally, I set up hosting to launch the website.

 
> Throughout the process, empathy was a crucial factor that I considered. I aimed to understand the customer's perspective and design an online store that met their needs and expectations. The design thinking process was iterative, and feedback was taken into account to refine the website continuously.
